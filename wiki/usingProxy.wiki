#summary Some good reason to deploy a tap proxy

=Using a Proxy Server=

An efficient TAP browser must use asynchronous services (AJAX) to be really user friendly. This technology can transform a simple HTML page into an real application. This mode is quite more comfortable than using pages generated by the server because only specific parts of the page are modified by user actions.

The Saada Web interface is based on the Ajax technology. It is made with one single page downloaded from the server with a lot of Javascript code. But, for security reasons, Ajax clients cannot access others server they come from (cross domain issue). That is a serious issue for our TAP browser which is supposed to be connected with any TAP service.

This limitation can be worked around by using an official hack (JSONP) or by using a proxy server relaying TAP VOTables to the client.

We suggest to use the proxy solution because it allows to keep JSON as exchange format between the client as the server. In one word, using JSON avoid any response parsing on client side. The proxy can be setup to convert VOTables into JSON strings with XSLT sheets.

=Session management=

The proxy server must manage user sessions (without login)  to remember who is connected to which TAP service. Users can furthermore switch from one service to another without loosing query history.

The session storage must contain a map of TAP contexts.

=Base of Meta-data=

As the number of TAP services is limited, it might be interesting to store on server side  meta data in JSON format and to deliver them with a Factory acting as a cache.

=Shopping Cart=

The shopping cart stores the references of all products users want to download. Products can be issued from multiple servers. The cart is unique for one session. A service must allow users to remove partially or totally cart content. References must be arranged in order to keep trace of the services data comes from.

Products to download can either be TAP responses (e.g. a catalogue extraction) or row set extracted from one response (ObsTap). The data table must be smart enough to propose “add to cart” links only for response rows referring to data files.

=Download facility=

The download facility can either return VOTables received from remote TAP services or deliver ZIP balls  (shopping cart content) with all requested file stored in one directory per service.This second mode could take a piece of time. For this reason cart download must be asynchronous (UWS service).

Downloaded product must stay a couple of days in the repository as cached data.
