<h3>TapHandle at a glance</h3>
<p>More than a simple browser, TapHandle captures the metadata
of astronomical datasets and offers a clear and handy interface on top of the TAP VO
infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>This application helps the user to discover, sort out and select datasets
of interest for the scientist. It shows for each discovered dataset a selection of tools that
the user may launch to go deeper in the data exploration, like image preview, spectral
model fitting, average map for a data cube, etc. 
</p>
<p>
TapHandle evolves towards more flexibility
to describe data sets with associated services that can explore and transform them
either with VO-aware applications but also with specific science tools developped in
the astronomical community. The SAMP protocol is at work to organize the data flow
between the various tools.</p>
